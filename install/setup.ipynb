    "# Installation and setup notebook for the CS/TH imaging analysis package\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook, using Python 3 code, will help you to set up the imaging analysis package to run on your local system. A separate notebook (not yet written as of 9.14.17) will instruct you on how to set it up to run on the Odyssey cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "__This notebook assumes you have already acquired the package from GitHub using the instructions provided in readme.md in this package.__\n",
    "\n",
    "- To get this package up and running locally, you will need to make sure you have the full list of prerequisite packages for csth-imaging installed on your system. You can find this list in the csth-imaging/dependencies folder. Most of these will already be present if you're using an Anaconda-based python distribution. You can skip this step for now if so.\n",
    "- As noted in readme.md for this package, the version of javabridge installed via PyPI/pip/Anaconda has a bug that prevents czi processing from working. You will need to install the new version at the link to make it work.\n",
    "- The two .py scripts in the csth-imaging/dependencies folder are essential scripts for czi import. The code cell below will help you copy these files into your python path so they can be imported smoothly."
